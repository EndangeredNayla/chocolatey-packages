    <releaseNotes>OpenLP 2.4.6 bugfixes
	Fixed a bug where the author type upgrade was being ignored because it was looking at the wrong table
	Fixed a bug where the songs_songbooks table was not being created because the if expression was the wrong way round
	Changed the songs_songbooks migration SQL slightly to take into account a bug that has (hopefully) been fixed
	Sometimes the timer goes off as OpenLP is shutting down, and the application has already been deleted
	Fixed opening the data folder (KDE thought the old way was an SMB share)
	Fixed a problem with the new QMediaPlayer not controlling the playlist anymore
	Added importing of author types to the OpenLP 2 song importer
	Fixed a problem with loading Qt's translation files
	Disabled the controls in the shortcut dialog unless a shortcut is actually selected</releaseNotes>
