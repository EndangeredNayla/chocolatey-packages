•	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.


From REDIST_ENU.txt (inside install directory)

The listed .msi files each install its enclosed components to a specific location on the destination computer.  This helps to ensure serviceability and technical support.  The .dll files enclosed in these .msi files are also available separately in this redist.txt.  However, distributions of these separate .dlls may result in issues of serviceability.  For more details, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94589

Private deployment detection via BreadCrumb:  Private deployment of just the native stack and explicit loading of SQL Server Compact Assembly via Assembly.LoadFrom(), .local file, or the use of DLL/COM redirection strategies are not supported and may result in serviceability issues.
