    <summary>The world's fastest auto clicker. Command line. Parameters auto-save</summary>
    <description>Free open source mouse auto clicker emulates Windows mouse clicks EXTREMELY QUICKLY, at hardware speed limit, using modern arrayed SendInput() Win32 API. Supports command line arguments, clicking parameters auto-save and RANDOM CLICKING. The only program utilizes fine tricks in Sleep()/SendInput() with arrays of 100-1000 mouse events, making up to 100000 clicks per second.

NEW Button "Batch folder" has been added to open a directory with *.bat files quickly; it simplifies command line usage a lot.
NEW Random clicking has been implemented. Just click the "Batch folder" button and see remarks in the *.bat files reside there in order how to use command line arguments and to enable random clicking.
NEW Different trigger keys in toggle mode (arbitrary selected  and Ctrl+) have been added.
NEW Window Always Top checkbox to keep the app's window topmost has been added.
NEW Different, INDEPENDENT trigger keys to begin/end the clicking in toggle mode.
