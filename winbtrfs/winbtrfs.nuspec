    <summary>An open-source btrfs driver for Windows</summary>
    <description>WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.
A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel,
and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included
as part of the free operating system [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/).

If your Btrfs filesystem is on a MD software RAID device created by Linux, you
will also need [WinMD](https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd) to get this to appear
under Windows.

See also [Quibble](https://github.com/maharmstone/quibble), an experimental
bootloader allowing Windows to boot from Btrfs, and [Ntfs2btrfs](https://github.com/maharmstone/ntfs2btrfs),
a tool which allows in-place conversion of NTFS filesystems.

First, a disclaimer:

You use this software at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage
it may do to your filesystem. It ought to be suitable for day-to-day use, but
make sure you take backups anyway.

Everything here is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL);
see the file LICENCE for more info. You are encouraged to play about with the
source code as you will, and I'd appreciate a note (mark@harmstone.com) if you
come up with anything nifty.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
