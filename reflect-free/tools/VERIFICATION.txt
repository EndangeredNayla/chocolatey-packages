The MST is created by me(TheCakeIsNaOH) in Orca- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/orca-exe

The MSI the MST is created from can be found in C:\windows\installers\reflect_setup<version>.msi during and after install of the Macrium reflect installer

The transform drops the NonInteractiveLicenseInit custom action from the InstallExecuteSequence in the macrium reflect installer. 
This is needed to allow silent installation.

The contents can be extracted by 7zip and inspected.
To verify checksums, the file can be downloaded from https://github.com/TheCakeIsNaOH/chocolatey-packages/tree/master/reflect-free/tools and checked against the version in the nupkg
