1. Download the .rar binary package from 
	x32: https://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp/files/innounp/innounp%200.50/innounp050.rar/download
	
2. Extract the .rar file, 7zip works fine

3. Check that the `innounp.exe` included in the nupkg and the extracted exe file from the rar have the same checksum.

----

The other licenses in the legal folder come from the *src.rar located next to the binary .rar in the URL above.
