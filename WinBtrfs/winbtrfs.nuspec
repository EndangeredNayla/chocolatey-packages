    <summary>A Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs</summary>
    <description>WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs. 
	A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows 7 onwards. It is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS.

First, a disclaimer:

This software is in active development - YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any damage it may do to your filesystem. 
DO NOT USE THIS DRIVER UNLESS YOU HAVE FULL AND UP-TO-DATE BACKUPS OF ALL YOUR DATA. Do not rely on Btrfs' internal mechanisms: SNAPSHOTS ARE NOT BACKUPS, AND DO NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SILENT CORRUPTION.

In other words, assume that the driver is going to corrupt your entire filesystem, and you'll be pleasantly surprised when it doesn't.

However, having said that, it ought to be suitable for day-to-day use.

Everything here is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL); see the file LICENCE for more info. 
You are encouraged to play about with the source code as you will, and I'd appreciate a note (mark@harmstone.com) if you come up with anything nifty. 
On top of that, I'm open to relicensing the code if you've a burning desire to use it on a GPL or commercial project, or what have you - drop me a line and we'll talk.</description>
