    <description>Whether we’re talking about the adept home-user or an administrator, O&O RegEditor makes the job easier and quicker. 
	It comes with an eminently user-friendly application, but it is really its portability that makes the life of an administrator much easier.

No installation is needed and all settings are saved in the Profile data, so that O&O RegEditor can easily be used on other computers. 
Special versions in 32 and 64-Bit are available, meaning certain registry entries can be edited on 64-Bit systems that are normally hidden from 32-Bit users.</description>
